# Toast Accessibility (Vue 3)

The Syncfusion Vue Toast component meets WCAG 2.2, Section 508, and ADA standards. Toasts function as live regions so screen readers announce new notifications automatically without requiring focus.

## Compliance Summary

| Accessibility Criteria | Support |
|---|---|
| WCAG 2.2 | ✅ Full |
| Section 508 | ✅ Full |
| Screen Reader (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver) | ✅ Full |
| Right-to-Left (RTL) | ✅ Full |
| Color Contrast | ✅ Full |
| Mobile Device | ✅ Full |
| Keyboard Navigation | Not Applicable* |
| Accessibility Checker Validation | ✅ Full |
| Axe-core Validation | ✅ Full |

> *Toast is a passive notification component — keyboard navigation is not applicable because toasts do not require interaction. Action buttons within toasts are keyboard-accessible via standard button focus.

## WAI-ARIA Attributes

The Toast implements the [WAI-ARIA Alert pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/):

| Attribute | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `role` | `"alert"` | Identifies the element as an urgent live region |
| `aria-live` | `"assertive"` | Announces toast content immediately, interrupting other screen reader speech |
| `aria-label` | descriptive string | Provides an accessible name for the toast region |

These attributes are applied automatically by the component — no manual ARIA setup required.

## Screen Reader Behavior

When a toast appears:
- Screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver) announce the toast content immediately via the `aria-live="assertive"` region
- Users do not need to focus the toast — announcement is automatic
- Action button labels are read when the button receives focus

---

## RTL Support

Enable right-to-left text direction with `enableRtl`:

```vue
<template>
  <ToastComponent
    ref="toastRef"
    title="إشعار"
    content="لديك رسالة جديدة"
    :enableRtl="true"
    :position="position"
    :created="onToastCreated"
  />
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, reactive } from 'vue';
import { ToastComponent } from '@syncfusion/ej2-vue-notifications';

const toastRef = ref(null);
const position = reactive({ X: 'Left', Y: 'Bottom' });
const onToastCreated = () => toastRef.value?.show();
</script>
```

RTL affects text direction, icon placement, progress bar direction, and layout alignment. When using RTL, consider changing `position.X` to `'Left'` so the toast appears on the right side of an RTL layout.

## Accessibility Best Practices

**Timeout duration:**
Give users enough time to read toast content. For users with cognitive or vision disabilities, consider:
- Increasing `timeOut` beyond 5000ms for text-heavy toasts
- Using `extendedTimeout` so toasts remain while the user hovers/focuses
- Offering `showCloseButton={true}` so users can dismiss at their own pace

**Color contrast:**
The built-in semantic classes (`e-toast-success`, `e-toast-info`, `e-toast-warning`, `e-toast-danger`) are tested for WCAG color contrast compliance. When overriding colors with custom CSS, verify contrast ratios meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).

**Audio notifications:**
When adding audio cues (see [toast-services.md](./toast-services.md)), always include the toast text content as an alternative for users with hearing disabilities.

**Reduced motion:**
Respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for users who are sensitive to animations:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .e-toast-container .e-toast {
    animation-duration: 0ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0ms !important;
  }
}
```
